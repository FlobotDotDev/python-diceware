## How the script works...

The script emulates `n` amount of dice rolls (user provided). 

1. The script gets a five digit number and matches that number to a word in the provided wordlist.
2. It adds a random ASCII punctuation character which becomes the delimeter.
3. It also adds a random number (1-4 in length) to the end.
4. Finally, it has a 50/50 chance of capitalizing the word.

## Usage

`python3 dice.py -h` Displays the help message.

`python3 dice.py n` Replace `n` with the amount of words you want in your password
